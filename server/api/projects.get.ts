This project is owned by TigernetHost OPC, the company where I completed my OJT, and provided real-world experience working within a team and integrating frontend solutions with an existing backend system.",

The game features shooting mechanics, enemy encounters, and a level-up system where players progress by defeating slimes while navigating an infinite scrolling environment. This project was created during my college years as a hands-on way to experiment with game logic, animations, and interactive mechanics using web technologies.",

      "description": "A twist on the classic Snake game built as a self-imposed coding challenge to further explore interactive web development. In addition to standard gameplay, the game introduces special pellets that reduce the snake's size and must be weakened through user interaction before they can be consumed. Players can level up to increase the snake's bite power, allowing it to deal damage to numbered pellets. This project demonstrates problem-solving, game-state management, and creative mechanic design in the browser.",
