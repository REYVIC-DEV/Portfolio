            I am a Filipino web developer focused on building clean, functional,
            and responsive web applications. I enjoy turning ideas and designs
            into working products through code. During my on-the-job training, I
            worked as a junior front-end developer on an ordering system using
            Nuxt, with foundational experience in Laravel and practical exposure
            to SQL databases through backend integration. I graduated in 2025
            and continue to improve my skills through real world projects. My
            goal is to build a stable and sustainable career in technology with
            one that allows me to live comfortably, support my family, and
            continue growing both professionally and personally.

            Outside of development, I enjoy playing video games casually,
            maintaining an active routine through daily morning walks or jogs,
            and spending my free time watching educational or tech-related
            videos. I also enjoy reading manhwa as a way to relax and recharge
            outside of work.
